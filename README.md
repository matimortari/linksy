# Linksy 🔗🌐

Create your own landing page for sharing links to your social media profiles, websites, and more! Linksy is a link aggregator website, inspired by [Linktree](https://linktr.ee), that makes it very easy for users or businesses to quickly set up a customizable and convenient page for all their links and share it with others.

It is my first full-stack project built all from scratch, and it's been an amazing learning experience. I've honed my skills mainly in the **React** and **Next.js** ecosystem, deepening my understanding on custom hooks, state management, multiple layouts and more. I've explored more on **Tailwind CSS** for styling, and **Recharts** for data visualization.
