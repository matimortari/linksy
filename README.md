# Linksy 🔗🌐

Inspired by [Linktree](https://linktr.ee), Linksy allows users to create a customizable landing page for sharing links to their social media profiles, websites, and more.

A simple and intuitive platform, with a clean and responsive design, which makes it very easy for users or businesses to quickly set up their own landing page and share it with their audience.

It is my first full-stack project built all from scratch, and it's been a amazing learning experience. I aimed to deepen my understanding of some concepts, such as custom hooks in **React**, state management & data fetching (in which **React Query** proved to be a great tool for me), multiple layouts in **Next.js**, responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**, and data visualization using **Recharts**.
